# Keycode
This is project to create a code editor deskop app what will be able to write code witchout using keyboard.




The concept for now is:

Terminal is build in text-line it means we don't have a window for this but we can write code in editor to do some stuff. Example:

if you want create new file you are writing something like this: -c in {this.corel}-app.js-   - this wiil be creating a file in folder corel
if you want make a file in this folder you only writing -c in {this}
